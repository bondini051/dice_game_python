## Dice Game
This project is a simple python project that I completed to see how long it would take me from start to finish to write a simple few lines of code simulating a roll of the dice. I saw this project challenge originally at https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/. I completed this project using a jupyter notebook in python 3 and used toggl to time myself.
